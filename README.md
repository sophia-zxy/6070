## Description

This data is released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution
Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy
(NDSAP), using this one can explore India’s air pollution levels at a more granular scale.

## We currently have multiple components:

• so2: Sulphur dioxide (µg/m3)

• no2: Nitrogen dioxide (µg/m3)

• rspm: Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (µg/m3)

• spm: Suspended Particulate Matter (µg/m3)

• pm2_5: PSI 2.5 (µg/m3)


SPM, RSPM, PM2.5 values are the parameters used to measure the quality of air based
on the number of particles present in it. Using these values, we are going to identify the
air quality over the period of time in different states of India.

Generate descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and
shape of a dataset’s distribution, excluding NaN values
## Problems we solved
Which is the state that has higher SO2 content?

Which is the state that has higher NO2 content?

What is the yearly trend in a particular state, say ‘Andhra Pradesh’?

## Usage
packages :
numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, datetime
